> [!info]+ SMART Method
SMART goals are a type of **Metric Goal** that forces you to refine until you have a goal that is: *Specific*, *Measurable*, *Achievable*, *Relevant*, and *Time-bound*.
>> [!faq]- Alternative Terms
> >These are the most common terms used for the acronym, but there are others used [Wikipedia's list of alternatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria#Common_usage). In practice, they all help steer you towards having a clear and defined goal.

## Goal Development

> [!tip]+ Initial Thought
What is your starting thought or goal?

*e.g., I want to get a new certificate in my field.*



> [!tip]+ Make it Specific
Is the goal specific? Does it have context? Does your goal define exactly what you want to do?

*e.g., Get a certificate in [name] from [source].*



> [!tip]+ Make it Measurable
Have you established how you'll measure your goal once your project is complete? If not, add a way to measure success or failure at the end of your project.

*e.g., Pass course series from [source] to earn a certificate in [name].*



> [!tip]+ Make it Achievable
Can you (and anyone else involved) reasonably hit your goal? Even if it's a stretch goal, make
sure this is something you can accomplish with your resources and other responsibilities.

*e.g., Pass the first course towards [name] certificate from [source].*


> [!tip]+ Make it Relevant
> Is the goal aligned with other goals and/or is there a good reason for setting it now?

*e.g., Pass the first course towards [name] certificate from [source] to demonstrate knowledge in [details].*



> [!tip]+ Make it Time-bound
When will you achieve your goal? Make sure you clarify your target date or time frame in your SMART goal.
The block tag "^FinalGoal" will let you quickly embed your goal elsewhere in your Obsidian Vault. e.g., `![[Certificate Name SMART Goal#^FinalGoal]]`

*e.g., Pass the first course towards [name] certificate from [source] to demonstrate knowledge in [details] by [date]*
^FinalGoal
